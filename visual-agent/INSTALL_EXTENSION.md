## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Connecting
1. Check if Mac app is running
2. Verify port 41899 is not blocked
3. Check browser console (F12) for error messages

### Screenshot Not Working
1. Ensure extension has proper permissions
2. Check if there's an active tab open
3. Look for permission prompts in Chrome

### Console Logs to Look For
- `ðŸš€ Visual Agent background script starting...`
- `ðŸ”— Visual Agent connected to Mac App`
- `ðŸ“¸ Extension: Screenshot captured...`
- `ðŸ’“ Sending heartbeat ping`

- `tabs`: To query active tab information
- `storage`: For local data storage
- `scripting`: To execute actions on web pages
- `<all_urls>`: To work on any website
