üöÄ High Impact, Low Cost (Phase 1 - Immediate)

  1. Enhanced Element Targeting (No tokens, high reliability)

  // Current: Index-based (brittle)
  click({ index: 5 })

  // Enhanced: Multi-strategy targeting (robust)
  click({
    index: 5,                    // Primary
    selector: ".submit-btn",     // CSS fallback
    text: "Submit",              // Text content fallback
    aria: "submit-button"        // Accessibility fallback
  })

  Benefits:
  - ‚úÖ Fixes replay brittleness (addresses experimental flag issue)
  - ‚úÖ Zero token cost increase
  - ‚úÖ Significantly improves success rates
  - ‚úÖ Easy to implement safely

  2. Intelligent Waiting System (No tokens, better UX)

  // Current: Fixed delays
  await sleep(2000);

  // Enhanced: Smart waiting
  await waitFor({
    condition: () => element.isVisible(),
    networkIdle: true,
    maxWait: 10000,
    checkInterval: 100
  });

  Benefits:
  - ‚úÖ Faster execution (eliminates unnecessary waits)
  - ‚úÖ More reliable (waits for actual conditions)
  - ‚úÖ Zero token cost
  - ‚úÖ Better user experience

  3. Error Recovery System (No tokens, self-healing)

  // Current: Fails immediately
  throw new Error("Element not found");

  // Enhanced: Recovery strategies
  const strategies = [
    () => scrollToElement(selector),
    () => waitForPageLoad(),
    () => tryAlternativeSelector(fallbacks),
    () => reportButContinue(error)
  ];

  Benefits:
  - ‚úÖ Reduces task failures dramatically
  - ‚úÖ Zero token cost
  - ‚úÖ Better user satisfaction
  - ‚úÖ Self-healing automation

  üîß Medium Impact, Low Cost (Phase 2 - Near Term)

  4. Performance Optimizations (No tokens, speed boost)

  - DOM Caching Improvements: Better cache invalidation
  - Connection Pooling: Reduce setup overhead
  - Batch Operations: Group similar actions
  - Lazy Loading: Only load what's needed

  5. Settings Enhancements (No tokens, better UX)

  - Setting Validation: Prevent invalid configurations
  - Import/Export: Share configurations
  - Profiles: Different settings per task type
  - Performance Monitoring: Built-in metrics

  6. Session Management (No tokens, workflow improvement)

  - Better History Storage: Efficient, searchable
  - Session Templates: Reusable workflow patterns
  - Bookmarking: Save important automation points
  - Session Analytics: Success/failure tracking

  ‚ö° High Impact, Medium Cost (Phase 3 - Future)

  7. Workflow Engine Foundation (Minimal tokens, major capability)

  interface SimpleWorkflow {
    steps: WorkflowStep[];
    conditions: { if: string, then: string, else?: string }[];
    retryLogic: RetryStrategy;
  }

  Implementation:
  - Start with linear workflows (no tokens needed)
  - Add simple conditionals (minimal token usage)
  - Build visual workflow builder
  - Prepare for complex logic later

  8. Enhanced Agent Coordination (Efficient token usage)

  - Agent Specialization: Navigator focuses on actions, Planner on strategy
  - Shared Context: Reduce repeated context sending
  - Smart Agent Selection: Use cheaper models for simple tasks
  - Context Compression: Summarize long sessions
