# Race Condition Fix - Enhanced Input Verification with Retry Logic

## Problem Analysis
The logs showed a perfect example of the race condition we were designed to catch:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è INPUT VERIFICATION FAILED (To recipients field): Expected "lloke634@gmail.com", found ""
‚ö†Ô∏è This indicates a race condition - element was clicked but text input was not completed
```

Our initial verification system was working perfectly - it correctly detected that:
1. Elements were being found and clicked successfully
2. Text input operations completed without throwing errors
3. **But the actual text was not appearing in the DOM elements**

## Root Cause
The issue occurs with complex web applications like Gmail that have:
- Dynamic DOM updates that reset field values
- Custom JavaScript event handlers
- Virtual DOM implementations
- Anti-automation protections
- Asynchronous form field initialization

## Solution: Enhanced Verification with Retry Logic

### New Implementation
Added `verifyInputWithRetry()` method that:

1. **Progressive Wait Times**: Uses increasing delays (200ms, 400ms, 600ms) to give the page time to process
2. **Automatic Retry**: Re-attempts input up to 3 times when verification fails
3. **Smart Recovery**: Clicks element again and re-inputs text on each retry
4. **Detailed Logging**: Provides step-by-step insight into retry attempts

### Key Features

#### Multi-Attempt Verification
```typescript
for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
  // Wait progressively longer for page processing
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200 * attempt));
  
  // Check if text actually appeared
  if (currentValue.toLowerCase().includes(expectedText.toLowerCase())) {
    return { success: true, message: ` - verification passed on attempt ${attempt}` };
  }
  
  // Retry input if failed
  if (attempt < maxRetries) {
    await page.clickElementNode(false, elementNode);
    await page.inputTextElementNode(false, elementNode, expectedText);
  }
}
```

#### Enhanced Logging
- `üîÑ RETRY INPUT ATTEMPT 1: Re-inputted text into Subject field`
- `‚úÖ INPUT VERIFICATION PASSED (Subject field) (attempt 2): Text "Leave Request" found`
- `‚ùå INPUT VERIFICATION FAILED AFTER 3 ATTEMPTS: Input may not have been completed`

## Expected Results
With this fix, the Gmail compose task should now:

1. **Detect the race condition** (already working)
2. **Automatically retry input** when verification fails
3. **Click and re-input text** up to 3 times
4. **Wait progressively longer** for Gmail's dynamic updates
5. **Report success** when text finally appears in DOM
6. **Gracefully handle persistent failures** with detailed diagnostics

## Testing
The next time the Gmail compose task runs, we should see logs like:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è INPUT VERIFICATION FAILED (To recipients field) (attempt 1): Expected "lloke634@gmail.com", found "" - retrying...
üîÑ RETRY INPUT ATTEMPT 1: Re-inputted text into To recipients field
‚úÖ INPUT VERIFICATION PASSED (To recipients field) (attempt 2): Text "lloke634@gmail.com" found in element value
```

## Files Modified
- `/extension/chrome-extension/src/background/agent/actions/builder.ts`
  - Enhanced `verifyInputWithRetry()` method with retry logic
  - Updated input_text action to use new verification
  - Maintained backward compatibility with legacy method

## Benefits
- **Solves race condition issues** in dynamic web applications
- **Self-healing**: Automatically recovers from temporary input failures  
- **Gmail-compatible**: Handles Gmail's complex form processing
- **Transparent debugging**: Clear logs show exactly what happened
- **No breaking changes**: Existing functionality preserved
